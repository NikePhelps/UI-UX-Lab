        <h2>Mortal Kombat's Microtransaction's Explained</h2>
        <p class="text">Mortal Kombat 11 is getting slammed over its supposed equipment grind and the perceived greed of 
            its microtransactions; user-submitted reviews on Steam and Metacritic have been poor. 
            In these reviews, as well as in comments and on social media, fans have complained about the slow 
            pace of earning rewards through gameplay and the randomness of rewards in the chest-strewn Krypt. 
            Some say the unforgiving grind for coins and hearts and souls, the materials needed to unlock reward 
            chests, seems like it is tailored to push players towards real money transactions as an alternative.
